        <p>
          A few years ago, my accountant and advisor told me that Mid-City needs to have agility to
          survive and thrive in the future. Looking back at the past several months, I can say,
          “Boy, was he ever right!”. Mid-City’s “agility ability” has helped us survive and thrive
          in this crazy pandemic economy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have had to rethink almost every aspect of our business, and that includes our
          award-winning Marketing Partnership Program. With sheltering-in-place and social
          distancing, most of the in-person marketing portion of our MPP (the customer Steak Frys,
          Holiday Hog Roasts and training classes, etc.) have been canceled for 2020. Instead, we
          chose to use those funds to help feed the needy and help the restaurants in our
          communities. We call this new program “Catering to the Community”. It has been well
          received by our customers and highly supported by our MPP partners. The rest of our
          Marketing Partnership Program remains basically unchanged.
        </p>

        <p>
          For our 2021, our 15th year of our Marketing Partnership Program, we plan to get back into
          it with much gusto. Our customers are eager to attend and participate in our Steak Frys
          and Hog Roasts, and your reps are ready to get back in front of our customers and continue
          selling your products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Telling is selling, and that is what our MPP is all about. Staying positive that the
          COVID-19 pandemic tide will recede, Mid-City anticipates a full schedule for 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thank you for being part of our Marketing Partnership Program in the past, and our team
          looks forward to partnering with you in the future. Please consider joining our 2021 MPP.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for being our valued partner!</p>
        <p>
          Sincerely, <br />Mid-City Supply Co., Inc.<br /><br />
